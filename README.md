# liri-node-app
node.js homework for UC Davis Coding Bootcamp

Getting Started
This is a node.js and npm practice app that utilizes several npm libraries to generate movie data, Twitter data, and Spotify Data


Prerequisites
node.js


Install the package.json
In your terminal:
$ npm i

From the same directory (wherever you've cloned it) you have the following commands to choose from:
spotifyThis
movieThis
twitterThis


For Example, type the following into your terminal:
$ node liri.js spotifyThis 'i love rock and roll'
$ node liri.js movieThis 'Titanic'
$ node liri.js twitterThis '@johnsmith'


Alternatively add your commands and search queries to random.txt in the following format:
command, query

or ---for example---

spotifyThis, i love rock and roll


Running the tests:
All examples should generate a log of your commands, search queries, and results in log.txt

Errors are handled by each individual function so play around with the search queries



See log.txt for examples of outputs that should be console.logged upon success.
